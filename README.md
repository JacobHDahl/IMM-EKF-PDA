## TTK4250 - Assignment 6

Code for a Probabilistic data association algorithm for single-target tracking.

## Code:

The files contain different run-files. run_imm_pda.py is an Interactive model mixture (IMM)-based probabilistic data association (PDA) which runs on simulated data. 

run_joyride_imm_pda.py is an IMM-PDA which runs on a real-world dataset.

run_joyride_ekf.py is an EKF-PDA which runs on a real-world dataset.

## How to run:

Run the chosen run-file in python 3.6 or higher. Recommended to run with -O flag.
